## Loading and preprocessing the data. 
## Assuming the data is in the current project

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv", header = TRUE)
--- convert date to convenient format
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)
activity <- cbind(activity,weekday)
summary(activity)
head(activity)

# summing steps over date
summed_steps<- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, FUN=sum)

head(summed_steps)
# I use the base plotting to show a histogram
hist(summed_steps$steps, 
     col="red", 
     xlab = "Frequency", 
     ylab = "Steps",
     main = "Total Number Of Steps Taken Each day")
     
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# Calculation
Mean <- mean(summed_steps$steps)
Median <- median(summed_steps$steps)
# Print results of mean and median
Mean
Median

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

#  of steps over time interval (of 5 min)
agginterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, FUN=sum)

#Plotting line graph using plot() from Base Plotting for Total Steps vs 5-Minute Interval
plot(agginterval$interval, agginterval$steps, 
     type = "l", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Total Steps",
     main = "Total Steps vs. 5-Minute Interval")

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
